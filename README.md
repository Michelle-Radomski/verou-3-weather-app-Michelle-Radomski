# Weather app
## The goal
After seeing the basics of Javascript it was time to learn how to use an API. What nicer way then to make a weather app and use real data to practise? 
As an optional goal we could also use a library (chart.js) to see what else we could do to manipulate and showcase our weather data. This was the very first time we used
an API + library.

## My inspiration ‚òÅ‚òÄÔ∏è
We all probably have an image in our mind when we think about the word 'weather', we associate it with colours for example. As you can see, I mainly focussed on the colour 
blue. I've noticed a lot of my classmates also used blue but ofcourse every project looked different. I wanted mine to be practical yet looking nice and playful. For some 
reason, this project screams 'The Simpsons' when I look back at it. Maybe because I really enjoyed watching the series üòÉ
